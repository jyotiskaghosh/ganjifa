# Cards

All cards in the game have a rank and a civilization.
There are only three card types in the game, they are:
1. Creatures: Are Cards that are summoned to the battlezone and are used to damage opponent's life as well as destroy opponent creatures, 
              they are also used to block incoming attacks. 
              They have Attack and Defence which are used in Battle and also have a Family.
              Any creature above rank 0 can only be played by evolving a creature in the battlezone who shares the same family(unless stated otherwise)
              and has rank one less than, equal or more than the creature.
2. Spells: Are cards that have various effects to alter the play of the game, and are usually sent to the graveyard after it's cast.
           Often, a Spell Card has a single effect to provide a bonus to the user or a weakness to the opponent.
           Spells Can't be cast unless there is a creature who shares their civilization and has rank higher or equal to their own in the battlezone.
3. Equipments: Equipments like spells have various effects to alter the play of the game, but unlike spells have more permanent effects and equipments also have attack and defense, which get added to the equipped creature.
               After being cast they are sent to the soul of a creature(underneath the creature stack) and the effects are passed on to the creature.
               Equipments can only be equipped by creatures that share their civilization and have rank higher or equal to their own in the battlezone.
               A creature can only equip one equipment, when another equipment is put the previously equiped equipment is sent to the graveyard.
               Equipments are moved along with the creatures they are equiped to.
